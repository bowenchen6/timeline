https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_locator_pattern
The service locator pattern is a design pattern used in software development to encapsulate the processes
involved in obtaining a service with a strong abstraction layer. This pattern uses a central registry
known as the "service locator", which on request returns the information necessary to perform a certain task.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern
In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers,
do not program the messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers,
but instead characterize published messages into classes without knowledge of which subscribers,
if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive messages that are of interest,
without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.
Publish–subscribe is a sibling of the message queue paradigm, and is typically one part of a larger message-oriented middleware system.
Most messaging systems support both the pub/sub and message queue models in their API, e.g. Java Message Service (JMS).
